# AngularJS-VideoPlayer

This is a project I completed with another developer.  It is a video player app, written in AngularJS, using the YouTube API for the data.  You can watch videos without having to deal with any commercials (a VERY nice bonus).

 ## To Run Locally
 
 Clone the repo.  You must have a YouTube API key in order to make requests to the YouTube API.  Once you have created one, copy it into the youtube.example.js file and rename the file to youtube.js.  Be sure not to push this file up to Github to keep your API key hidden.
